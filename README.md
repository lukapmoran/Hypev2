# Hype V2
Hype V2 was a Minecraft server plugin (Bukkit plugin) I wrote for myself and my friends to use back in 2012-2013. It was the second big programming project I ever undertook, with Hype V1 being the first. To those who see this, I hope you enjoy a foray into the mind of a newly-minted **14yo developer**.

For a brief overview, the plugin includes the following:
- Squads (factions)
- Shops
- Armour abilities
- Chat channels
- Administration (permissions, banning, muting, etc)
- and more...

The **vast** majority of this code is my own, though the tornado code may have been taken from elsewhere. The plugin was never publicly or commercially available.
